# Game 1 - Idle Quest

## Context

You are a party of adventurers who explore different regions of the world.  Be it the scorching deserts of fire, or the frozen caves of ice, or even the unholy dungeons of darkness-- you are not fearful.

## Player Side Setup

- Enemies come from the right
- Player positions adventurers into a formation of their choosing on a 3x3 grid
- Party adventurers are made of different class combinations, which are a template of
    - Determines usable weapon, armor, and accessory slot types allowed
    - Maybe some additional skills or skilltree for abilities they use
    - Combinations of range for weapons, elements available, and skills
- Adventurers have a level, which affects some stats
- Adventurers can equip items
    - Weapon type (bow vs axe vs sword), which can be equipped to certain classes
    - Range of attacks - How many squares away can they hit (diagonal too).. if it's 1, it's a melee weapon.. but maybe a polearm can hit 2 away to start
    - Attack "type" - piercing, blunt, "magic"?
    - Attack "element" - fire, ice, shadow, holy
    - Rate of attack
    - Damage distribution - when it hits, does it splash? or is it just a single enemy

## Enemy Side Setup

- Everything is just a campaign/quest/adventure/delve, the only difference is settings related to that "quest" or "area"
- Based on the type of area, it primarily defines the types of enemies you'll encounter, as well as their stats/defenses
    - A firey magma area probably has creatures of fire, which will be susceptible to ice damage.. and resistant to fire attacks.. you might also want to wear fire gear to resist their attacks
    - Undead skeletons take increased bludgeoning and holy damage, but maybe are resistant to shadow
    - This isn't always going to be super simple, but gives players choice about how to equip as they go into a quest


## Game Loop

- Start game and get a party generated for you (maybe tank, dps, healer) to start with
- Do initial quests which may only involve one lane, two, or three (1x3 vs 2x3 vs 3x3)
    - Unlock more lanes later
- Level up adventurers to do more damage, get better gear, fight more stuff

## Endgame

- Some weekly challenge randomly generated dungeon
- Leaderboards
- Endless dungeon

## Why is it fun?

- Placement of units
- Countering enemy strengths and weaknesses (attacks and defensives)
- Boss killing
